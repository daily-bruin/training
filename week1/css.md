# CSS
All our HTML pages so far, frankly, look kinda ugly and reminiscent of a [CS class page](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/). We can fix that with __CSS__!

We were going to write a CSS guide, but then we realized that we were basically copying Mozilla's and since it was better anyways, we figured we should just link you to [their's instead](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS). Read through it! Be sure to especially focus on the sections about __selectors__, __units__, and the __box model__.
