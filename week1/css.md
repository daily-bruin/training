# CSS
All our HTML pages so far, frankly, look kinda ugly and reminiscent of a [CS class page](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/). We can fix that with __CSS__!

We were going to write a CSS guide, but then we realized that we were basically copying Mozilla's and since it was better anyways, we figured we should just link you to [their's instead](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS) (**mandatory**). Read all the sections and be sure you especially understand selectors, how the cascade and inheritance work, and the box model.

## TL;DR
You can style a web page through CSS. CSS provides a lot of different properties to choose from as well as selectors to specify what parts of a web page you want to style. Each HTML element is represented as a box of content with a height and a width, padding, border, and margin. Almost all aspects of designing a site is done with CSS, so get to know it well!
