## Introduction to Journalism
Even though you will be working in the Online department of the Daily Bruin, you are still considered to be a journalist. __What does it mean to be a journalist?__ As a journalist, you are a storyteller.

> Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.

What's the purpose of journalism?

- To give a voice to the voiceless
- To keep people/groups accountable
- To keep readers informed about the larger world — it's empowering and fun!
- To educate readers

To be a good journalist, follow the [SPJ Code of Ethics](http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp). The major sections are:

- Seek truth and report it
- Minimize harm
- Act independently
- Be accountable and transparent

### Data Journalism

Online in particular does a lot of __[Data Journalism](http://stack.dailybruin.com)__. What does that mean? As a data journalist, you tell stories through data using interactive or static visualizations.

Types of data journalism that you might be doing:

- Standalone stories (a project that mostly formats and supports the text)
- Standalone graphics/interactives (that tell a story by themselves)
- Supporting graphics/interactives for a story
- Live coverage

### Examples of Online Journalism
