If you're looking for even more examples of personal sites from student developers, [Hackathon Hackers Websites and Resumes Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1487708811477672/) is also a good place to check out other peopleâ€™s personal sites, and receive feedback on your own.

If you're interested in hosting your site, check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). We're just expecting you to make a site using HTML, CSS, and Git, though, so don't feel pressured to publish it!
