# Python
Python is pretty versitile, relatively easy to understand, and widely used programming language. Because of this, we often program our servers in Python using frameworks such as [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), depending on our needs.

A note on the versioning of Python: there are 2 major version of Python, Python 2 and Python 3. We use Python 3 here at the Daily Bruin.

## Installation
### Windows
To install Python, run the command:
```shell
choco install python
```

You can now run python with the `python` command from your terminal! Test this by typing:

```shell
python --version
```

You should get something like: `Python 3.6.2`.

### Mac
To install Python, run the command:
```shell
brew install python3
```

You can now run python with the `python3` command from your terminal! Test this by typing:

```shell
python3 --version
```

You should get something like: `Python 3.6.2`.

## Hello World
Since you've already seen a hello world program with HTML and JavaScript, we thought we'd show you another one in python because #whynot.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Yeah. It's pretty simple.

## The rest of python
We haven't had time to finish this bit yet, so we'll wing this!
