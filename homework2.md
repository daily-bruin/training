# Homework 2
This homework is designed to help you utilize additional HTML/CSS practices and familiarize you with the Git team workflow.

You'll be working with our [flatpage template](https://github.com/daily-bruin/flatpage-template), so take the time to download it and familiarize yourself with the workflow.

## Work with your team to create a site using the flatpage template
Create a website with your team! There are no real constraints on this project, be as creative as you can! 

Here are some basic things that we'd like to see:
- At least one commit from each team member
- Use  pull requests to manage code
- Utilize Nunjucks blocks and partials
- _Bonus:_ Pull in data from an outside source and use Nunjucks to display that data.
    - Here's the [JSON file](https://gist.github.com/hongee/e83270061eebd94e9ee5d32fb25be3a9
) we used to build [Registration Issue](http://features.dailybruin.com/regissue-2017) ([Github](http://github.com/daily-bruin/regissue-2017))
    - [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=JSON) has a lot of cool JSON data sets you can play around with
- Use a Sass feature that's not available in vanilla CSS
- Use linters and BEM for nice code

We'll be learning Django in future training sessions, so it'd be super cool if you build a website that allows us to add in backend functionality at a later date
