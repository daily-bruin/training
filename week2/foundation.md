# Foundation
Many websites end up needing a lot of the same code to handle problems such as responsivity or layout. This is where web frameworks come in: they contain a lot of CSS and JavaScript code that implement features common to many websites such as grid sytems, dropdown menus, image galleries and more.

There are two main web frameworks: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com). The Bruin uses Foundation.
