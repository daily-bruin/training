# Stylelint
Stylelint is a linter for CSS and Sass code. We briefly touched on linting last week, but to review: a linter is a program that performs what's called _static analysis_ of code. It checks code for any style or syntax errors. They're very useful, espicially when maintaining a codebase over time.

## Installation
You want to have a stylelint plugin for your text editor. The one for Atom is called [linter-style](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint).

## Configuration
At the Daily Bruin, we use [UCLA Radio's stylelint configuration](https://github.com/uclaradio/stylelint-config-uclaradio) (_optional_) (yay student media!). It's already set up in the flatpage template, so just make sure your editor plugin is configured!

You can often get a good feel for coding style by reading through other people's style guides. Here are some great ones, which are all (**mandatory**):
- [Google: HTML and CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
- [Airbnb: CSS / Sass Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/css)
- [Harry Roberts: CSS Guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es)
- [Hugo Giraudel: Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es) (come back to this one after you've read about [Sass](week2/sass.md)!)
