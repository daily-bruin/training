# Stylelint
[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) is a linter for CSS and Sass code. We briefly touched on linting last week, but to review: a linter is a program that performs what's called _static analysis_ of code. It checks code for any style or syntax errors. They're very useful, espicially when maintaining a codebase over time.

## Installation
You want to have a stylelint plugin for your text editor. The one for Atom is called [linter-style](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint).

## Configuration
At the Daily Bruin, we use [UCLA Radio's stylelint configuration](https://github.com/uclaradio/stylelint-config-uclaradio) (yay student media!). It's already set up in the flatpage template, so just make sure your editor plugin is configured!
