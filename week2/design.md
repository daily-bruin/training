## Design

While knowing the technical skills to create a project is essential to your time here at the Daily Bruin, how you present your projects to our readers is also extremely important.
You'll be working closely with the design department over your time here, and they'll be able to provide you with feedback and advice. That said, it's important to know some fundamentals so you can provide our users with the best experience possible.

### Elements of Design

Designing isn't easy! Good design incorporates both aesthetics and functionality - you want your service to look good but also be easy to use. We'll go over some basics below.

#### Color
Color helps to define the mood and feel of your project. Lighter topics (like a [Coachella flatpage](http://graphics.dailybruin.com/coachella-2017/)) may feature a more vibrant colors, while a more serious story (like a [Bridget O' Brien project](http://yolanda.dailybruin.com) dealing with typhoon recovery) will tend to feature more muted colors.

It's also important to utilize and recognize the difference between warmer and cooler colors. You can take a look at [this article](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/04/07/how-to-create-the-right-emotions-with-color-in-web-design/) to see how different colors correpsond to different emotional responses.

Don't go overboard on color! The article linked above has a section on color schemes, and gives you a few ways you can combine different colors in your project. [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com) is a really useful tool that can help you pick color schemes that work well together.

#### Layout and Hierarchy
Know the weight and importance of the different elements on the user's screen. Elements like headlines, pull quotes and featured art should be given additional weight and precedence over less important elements. This can be done by designating a larger font size or adding an emphasis via color.

#### Typography
Typography, much like color, helps to define the mood of the project. Let's start by talking about the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts. A serif is the little hook that you see at the end of a letter. The best way to explain the difference between the two fonts is with a diagram, so check out the one below!![Sans-serif vs serif](https://visualhierarchy.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/serif-sansserif.jpg "Sans-serif vs serif")

Serif fonts are generally considered to be more classic and formal, while sans-serif fonts are considered more modern. One good way to see this contrast in a real world scenario is to examine the differences between [UCLA's](http://brand.ucla.edu) and [USC's](https://identity.usc.edu) brand guides. UCLA focuses on elements like optimism and innovation, while USC really tries to play up a sense of tradition and history.

We can additionally take a look at UCLA's [Centennial Campaign website](https://lettherebe.ucla.edu). In an effort to appeal to donors' sense of history, UCLA uses a serif font for emphasis, rather than its normal sans-serif font.

#### Usability
Your site should be easy to use! If complex or complicated elements make the site difficult to navigate, don't include them. As the saying goes, "if it isn't broken, don't fix it". While it may be exciting for you to create an entirely new interaction paradigm, a user doesn't necessarily want to learn a new format every time they read a story from the Daily Bruin.

Make sure that your sites scale well to mobile. Over 50% of the Bruin's traffic now comes from mobile devices, so its important that users have the best experience possible, regardless of the device that they're using. Front end frameworks like [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com) can be realy helpful for making your site mobile friendly.
