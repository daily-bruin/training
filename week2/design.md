# Design

While knowing the technical skills to create a project is essential to your time here at the Daily Bruin, how you present your projects to our readers is also extremely important. You'll be working closely with the design department over your time here, and they'll be able to provide you with feedback and advice. That said, it's important to know some fundamentals so you can provide our users with the best experience possible.

Design is a huge field, so in this reading, we'll try to give you a broad overview of some terms and ideas to get you started in the right direction. Remember that designing isn't easy! Good design incorporates both aesthetics and functionality - you want your service to look good but also be easy to use.

## UX
The word “design” can refer to anything from architecture to fashion, so when we’re talking about designing digital products like apps and websites, probably the most common term you’ll see used is __UX Design__. UX (User Experience) design is really the highest level of design thinking for a product and aims to answer a couple vital questions:
- Who are my users?
- What do they want and need?
- How can they connect with my product?

So basically UX designers need make a product usable, accessible, and enjoyable to use. How do they do this? Through a little bit of all of the more specific design fields I’m about to get into: they interview users, create mockups, architect hierarchies, and create solutions to problems, among other things.

## UI
UI, or User Interface, design is probably the second most well known design term. You’ll often see job titles such as UI/UX or UX/UI designer. Although the fields of user experience and user interface design are closely related, [they aren’t the same](http://www.helloerik.com/ux-is-not-ui) (**mandatory**). While UX focuses on the entire product (the experience associated with it, if you will), UI focuses only how how the product looks. They’re the ones who make pretty buttons and icons.

### Color
Color helps to define the mood and feel of your project. Lighter topics (like a [Coachella flatpage](http://graphics.dailybruin.com/coachella-2017/)) may feature a more vibrant colors, while a more serious story (like a [Bridget O' Brien project](http://yolanda.dailybruin.com) dealing with typhoon recovery) will tend to feature more muted colors.

It's also important to utilize and recognize the difference between warmer and cooler colors. Read through [this article](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/04/07/how-to-create-the-right-emotions-with-color-in-web-design/) (**mandatory**) to see how different colors correpsond to different emotional responses.

Don't go overboard on color! The article linked above has a section on color schemes, and gives you a few ways you can combine different colors in your project. [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com) is a really useful tool that can help you pick color schemes that work well together.

### Typography
Typography is the art of arranging letters, which is a big asset for UI work. Typography is also big field outside of UI design, though—books, newspapers, magazines, posters all require a designer with great typographic skills. Since I’m assuming most people reading this will be thinking about design in relation to a digital product, I’ll make this note: print and digital design are very different so be careful when looking for resources online to know which medium is being referred to. How people both physically and psychologically read is different when the medium is paper versus a screen, and what could be great advice for one may not translate well for the other.

Typography, much like color, helps to define the mood of the project. Let's start by talking about the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts. A serif is the little hook that you see at the end of a letter. The best way to explain the difference between the two fonts is with a diagram, so check out the one below!![Sans-serif vs serif](https://visualhierarchy.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/serif-sansserif.jpg "Sans-serif vs serif")

Serif fonts are generally considered to be more classic and formal, while sans-serif fonts are considered more modern. One good way to see this contrast in a real world scenario is to examine the differences between [UCLA's](http://brand.ucla.edu) and [USC's](https://identity.usc.edu) brand guides. UCLA focuses on elements like optimism and innovation, while USC really tries to play up a sense of tradition and history.

We can additionally take a look at UCLA's [Centennial Campaign website](https://lettherebe.ucla.edu). In an effort to appeal to donors' sense of history, UCLA uses a serif font for emphasis, rather than its normal sans-serif font.

### Layout and Hierarchy
Know the weight and importance of the different elements on the user's screen. Elements like headlines, pull quotes and featured art should be given additional weight and precedence over less important elements. This can be done by designating a larger font size or adding an emphasis via color.

## Usability
Usability is, as the name suggests, the field of making a product usable. Where UX focuses on the experience making emotional connection a customer, usability is more concerned with something more basic: ensuring that all users can use the product and effectively as possible.

Your site should be easy to use! If complex or complicated elements make the site difficult to navigate, don't include them. As the saying goes, "if it isn't broken, don't fix it". While it may be exciting for you to create an entirely new interaction paradigm, a user doesn't necessarily want to learn a new format every time they read a story from the Daily Bruin.

Make sure that your sites scale well to mobile. Over 50% of the Bruin's traffic now comes from mobile devices, so its important that users have the best experience possible, regardless of the device that they're using. Front end frameworks like [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com) can be realy helpful for making your site mobile friendly.

## Interaction Design
Interaction design (IxD) involves how a user interacts with a product. This also overlaps a lot with fields such as UI design and usability.

A big part of interaction design I worked on this summer was thinking about web form design. A lot of research has gone into how a form is designed, a completed form translates directly into a completed sale for many companies. Simple details such as  where labels are placed and how many fields are in a form can drastically affect user conversion.

## Accessibility
A big part of creating a product that’s often ignored (and really shouldn’t be) is accessibility. Part of this is [technical](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) (_optional_), but part of accessibility is design: see if your product is still usable without color or with a screen reader or without a mouse.

Accessibility ties in with interaction design, usability, and UI design.

## Information Architecture
Information architecture is a fancy way for talking about how a site is laid out. What items go in a navigation bar, what links are on a page, and how a user flows throughout a site are all information architecture problems. The answers to these problems come from user research and stakeholder goals.

## User Research and Interviews
After working on a project for about 2–4 weeks, it becomes impossible to design for it; you’ve become too focused on it to know how a user would use it. Thus, doing research—watching your users actually use your site to perform tasks and asking them questions about what they like and don’t—is absolutely critical if you want your site to be useful.

## Human-Computer Interaction
While most other design fields mentioned so far have been very applied, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), is much more theoretical. It researches how people design and use technology, utilizing multiple disciplines in the process: computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive science, design, and many more fields.

## TL;DR
Design is a huuuuuuge field. But even if you aren't planning on focusing on design, you should know the basics of UX and UI design, accessibility, information architecture, and usability.
