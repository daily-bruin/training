# Sass
Sass is known as a CSS preprocessor—it's a superset of CSS that has all of the same features and syntax of CSS, with more additional features. It bills itself as "CSS with Superpowers". Sass has to be compiled down to CSS, which we'll cover.

You may also see notes about Sass vs SCSS online. Both are Sass, but Sass has two different syntaxes. DB uses the SCSS syntax, which is more widely used and easier to learn. SCSS syntax looks like CSS, Sass syntax has a lot of whitespace. Know that when we refer to Sass, we're referring to the SCSS syntax.

- [Partials](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4) and [Import](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-5)

## Compiling
Browsers only understand Sass, not CSS, so all Sass code must be compiled to CSS. This is handled automatically by the flatpage template!

## TL;DR
Sass is a cool extension to CSS that you should use! Browsers only understand CSS, though, so make sure you compile it to CSS first!
