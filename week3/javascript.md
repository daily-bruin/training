# JavaScript
JavaScript. It's StackOverflow's [most popular programming language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies) (_optional_), mostly because you have to use it in some way if you want to do any kind of web programming. JavaScript has had a pretty long and confusing history.

Before we get too much into JavaScript, check out [this video](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (**mandatory**). It's okay if you don't understand everything in it yet, we'll go over it!

We were going to write a JavaScript tutorial but then Nathan found a [really cool site for learning JavaScript online](https://javascript.info) and he had two midterms this week, so we'll link to those tutorials instead and occasionally offer up wisdom when we feel like it's necessary.
