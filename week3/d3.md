# D3.js
D3 is a JavaScript library that visualizes data using HTML, CSS and SVG. This library is especially relevant if you're interested in contributing to [The Stack](http://stack.dailybruin.com).

D3 has a lot of nuances, but it'll be really helpful if you get to know it well. One especially helpful website to peruse is [learnjsdata.com](http://learnjsdata.com), which will take you through the whole data visualization process - from reading through a CSV/JSON file, to actually manipulating it with D3.js. You should also take a look at the [D3.js documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) as well as [some examples built with D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery).
