## A Note on These Notes and Links
This cool statistician and computer scienctist named Edward Tufte [really hates Powerpoints](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pi/2016_2017/phil/tufte-powerpoint.pdf) (_optional_). Instead he advocates that the best way to present technical information to a group is to distribute written reports to be read by everyone and then have the presenter use the meeting time to review and answer questions on that topic. So we're going to do that for Online training sessions! We'll assume that you've done the required reading and set up before every session and then review, answer questions, and work on real examples in the session. Moral of the story: read all of the notes before each weekly session. Read the links marked (**mandatory**). If you have time, check out the (_optional_) links tooâ€”they're cool!
